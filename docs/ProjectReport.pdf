2. Abstract
This project implements a Personal Life Management System using the C programming language.
It includes five independent modules:
Expense, Habit, Health, Study, and Reminder.
The project uses modular programming, file handling, and date–time based logging.
It demonstrates key concepts from all units of C programming: functions, structures, loops, 
arrays, and file operations.


3. Problem Definition
In daily life, people handle multiple tasks: managing expenses, maintaining habits, 
monitoring health data, keeping track of study hours, and setting reminders.
The problem is that all this information is usually scattered.
This project solves that by creating ONE C program that manages all these activities 
in one place.


4. System Design
The system uses a modular architecture:
Each module has its own .c and .h files.
main.c contains the central menu.
Data is stored using text files (e.g., expenses.txt, habits.txt).
All modules use reusable functions.

Modules:
Expense Tracker
Habit Tracker
Health Tracker
Study Tracker
Reminder System


5. Algorithm (Overall Program Flow)
   i)    Start the program
   ii)   Display main menu:
             Expense Tracker
             Habit Tracker
             Health Tracker
             Study Tracker
             Reminder System
             Exit
   iii)  Read user choice
   iv)   If Expense selected → go to Expense Menu
   v)    If Habit selected → go to Habit Menu
   vi)   If Health selected → go to Health Menu
   vii)  If Study selected → go to Study Menu
   viii) If Reminder selected → go to Reminder Menu
   ix)   Each module performs:
              Add Data
              View Data
              Generate Summary
   x)    Return to main menu
   xi)   If Exit → terminate the program


6. Flowchart
[Start]
   |
   v
[Main Menu]
   |
   +-- (1) Expense Module ----> [Expense Menu] ----> [Operations] ----> Back
   |
   +-- (2) Habit Module ------> [Habit Menu] ------> [Operations] ----> Back
   |
   +-- (3) Health Module -----> [Health Menu] -----> [Operations] ----> Back
   |
   +-- (4) Study Module ------> [Study Menu] ------> [Operations] ----> Back
   |
   +-- (5) Reminder Module ----> [Reminder Menu] ---> [Operations] ----> Back
   |
   +-- (6) Exit
   |
  [End]


7. Implementation 
All source code is kept inside the /src folder.
All header files are kept inside /include.
Every module uses:
    addSomething()
    viewSomething()
    summary() (if required)
File handling ensures permanent storage of data.
Time/date functions (from <time.h>) store month/day/year automatically.


8. Testing & Output
The program was tested with multiple inputs:

Expense Module:
    Added expenses
    Viewed expense list
    Monthly summary generated correctly

Habit Module:
    Habits added
    Marked as completed
    Verified stored status

Health Module:
    Steps & calories logged
    Full activity log printed

Study Module:
    Study hours added
    Daily study summary accurate

Reminder Module:
    Reminders created
    Displayed properly

Program compiled using:
gcc src/*.c -I include -o main

Result:
  No crashes
  All menus working
  File handling stable


9. Conclusion
The Personal Life Management System successfully integrates 5 daily-life modules into one C program.
The project demonstrates modular programming, file handling, menu-driven logic, and real-time data logging.

Future improvements:
    Convert into GUI
    Add database (SQL)
    Add notifications
